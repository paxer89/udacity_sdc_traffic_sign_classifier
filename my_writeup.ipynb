    "### Writeup / README\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one. You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf. You can use this template as a guide for writing the report. The submission includes the project code.\n",

    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I plottet some random sign images and the related label to check if the date set ist correctly labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "I normalized the image data  with `(X_train - 127.5)/127.5 ` to approx sclae of -1 to 1 to avoid too large neccesary weights while training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I randomized the training date set with\n",

    "from sklearn.utils import shuffle\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used an batch size of 128 and 25 epochs and a dropout rate of 50%.\n",
    "The learning rat ewas 0.0005.\n",
    "As optimizer AdamOptimizer was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "logits = LeNet(x)\n",
    "cross_entropy = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=one_hot_y, logits=logits)\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 98.7%\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 93,9%\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 93,4%\n",
    "\n",
    "I started with the LeNet architechture from the lab in the previous lesson. At first I had to adjust the parameters to the different image size und the 3 color channels. After normalizing the images the model had pretty good results on the training data but a huge gap between the training date accuracy and the validation accuracy. So added dropouts with a dropout probability of 50% to the fully connected layers to prevent the modle from overfitting.\n",
    "Afterwards I played around a bit with the hyperparameters. I ended up with half of the initial learning rate and 30 training epochs. With that training rate the modle seemed to not further Improve after 30 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many possibilities to further improve my model. I could play around with the amount of layers and the depth in the convoloutional layers. I could try to exchange the max pooling layers for example with dropouts, maybe with a lower dropout probability as in the fully connected layers. I could also try out inception moudules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to improve the model would be to augment the training data set for example by rotating the images or by \"zooming\" in and out. that should mostly helpt with the images found in the internet which aren't completely similar to the training data set.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Test a Model on New Images\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] \n",
    "![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8] ![alt text][image9]\n",
    "\n",
    "The last image might be difficult to classify because there is an extra sign beneath an a bigger share of the pciture not showing the sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the results of the prediction:\n",

    "\n",
    "The model was able to correctly guess 5 of the 6 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 83.3%. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first 5 images were clearly visible and similarly scaled as the training date so it was expected that they're correctly classified. The last one which was too different form the training data unfortunately wasn't correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first 5 images, the model output is a probability of nearly one for the correct class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatly for the 6th image the model output is a wrong class with a probability of nearly 1. The correct class shows up on fourth place with a prbability of only 1.22e-11. thats not what's ideally expected from a model. If the model is unsafe in it's prediction it should output a largely spreaded probability over different classes.\n"
